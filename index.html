      <h1>Beyond the Mood Swings</h1>
      <br>
      <p>This research aims to explore if (and how) general anxiety levels vary throughout the phases of the menstrual
        cycle in women who are naturally cycling, without using hormonal birth control. Additionally, the study
        investigates potential changes in social understanding between the follicular and luteal phases by using Theory
        of Mind tasks.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to learn more about my Master's thesis! My name is Nikki Rademaker.
        I am a 24-year-old Master's student in the Media Technology MSc program at Leiden University.
        I am especially interested in topics that are often overlooked, like women's health.
        With this project, I hope to contribute to research that is more inclusive of the female experience.
        I also hope it helps participants and others gain more awareness of how their anxiety may change throughout the
        menstrual cycle to better understand, recognize, and manage those possible fluctuations in daily life.
        It would truly mean a lot to me if you choose to participate or share this study with someone who might be
        interested. Your support helps make this research possible.</p>

      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>This graduation project explores how and if anxiety levels change during the different phases of the menstrual
        cycle in women who are not using hormonal birth control.
        Participants will fill in a short daily survey for two full cycles to report how anxious they felt each day.
        The study also includes a simple task where participants read short stories and answer questions to see how well
        they understand social situations.
        This is done to find out if changes in anxiety may also affect affective Theory of Mind abilities, which involve
        recognizing others' emotions and intentions.
        The overall main goal of this study is to better understand if and when anxiety tends to increase across the
        cycle, and how this might relate to hormonal changes.</p>
